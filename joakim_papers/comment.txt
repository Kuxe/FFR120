collision-avoidance-for-multiple-agent-systems
Pros: 	Fairly simple (only 5 pages!)
		Agents are only locally aware of surroundings
		No centralized control
		Each agent can have unique target location

Cons:
		Perhaps not reflecting typical pedestrian movement very well
		Performance unknown
		Not sure if each agent can have preferred velocity

Reciprocal_n-body_Collision_Avoidance
Pros:	Good performane (1000 agents ~ 16ms in their tests)
		Each agent has preferred velocity
		No centralized control

Cons:	Perhaps not reflecting typical pedestrian movement very well
		Agents are globally aware of surroundings
		Agents do not have target locations
